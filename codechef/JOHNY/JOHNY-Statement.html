  <p>Vlad enjoys listening to music. He lives in Sam's Town. A few days ago he had a birthday, so his parents gave him a gift: MP3-player! Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!</p> 
  <p>Vlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of <b>N</b> songs, each has a <b>unique</b> positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named "Uncle Johny".</p> 
  <p>After creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, "Uncle Johny" was on <b>K</b>-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.</p> 
  <p>Vlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of "Uncle Johny" in the sorted playlist.</p> 
  <h3>Input</h3> The first line of the input contains an integer 
  <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
  <b>T</b> test cases follows. 
  <p> </p> The first line of each test case contains one integer 
  <b>N</b> denoting the number of songs in Vlad's playlist. The second line contains 
  <b>N</b> space-separated integers 
  <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, 
  <b>A<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., 
  <b>A<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the lenghts of Vlad's songs. The third line contains the only integer 
  <b>K</b> - the position of "Uncle Johny" in the initial playlist. 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Output</h3> For each test case, output a single line containing the position of "Uncle Johny" in the sorted playlist. 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Constraints</h3> 1 ≤ 
  <b>T</b> ≤ 1000 
  <p> </p> 1 ≤ 
  <b>K</b> ≤ 
  <b>N</b> ≤ 100 
  <p> </p> 1 ≤ 
  <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ 10

  <h3>Explanation</h3> 
  <p>In the example test there are <b>T</b>=3 test cases.</p> 
  <p><b>Test case 1</b></p> 
  <p>In the first test case <b>N</b> equals to 4, <b>K</b> equals to 2, <b>A</b> equals to {1, 3, 4, 2}. The answer is <b>3</b>, because {1, 3, 4, 2} -&gt; {1, 2, 3, 4}. <b>A<sub>2</sub></b> now is on the <b>3</b>-rd position.</p> 
  <p><b>Test case 2</b></p> 
  <p>In the second test case <b>N</b> equals to 5, <b>K</b> equals to 5, <b>A</b> equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is <b>4</b>, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -&gt; {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. <b>A<sub>5</sub></b> now is on the <b>4</b>-th position.</p> 
  <p><b>Test case 3</b></p> 
  <p>In the third test case <b>N</b> equals to 5, <b>K</b> equals to 1, <b>A</b> equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is <b>1</b>, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -&gt; {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. <b>A<sub>1</sub></b> stays on the <b>1</b>-th position.</p>
